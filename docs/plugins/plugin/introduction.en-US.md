# What is a Kraken plugin

Kraken plugin is a Flutter plugin that can be used to extend Kraken's capabilities. It can be published to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) and can be installed via pub.

Kraken's rendering capabilities can be customized through the Kraken plugin, including custom tags, and adding custom APIs to the global JS environment.

For details, see [Development Plugins](/plugins/plugin/development).

## The range of capabilities of the Kraken plugin

Kraken supports extensions in the following ways:

1. Use JavaScript to add new APIs and implement them through Dart.
2. Use Flutter Widget to add new HTML tags to get richer rendering capabilities.
